# Awesome_QuantumCloud
Implementing  research  papers and fundamental algorithms using Dwave's leap service And IBM qubit  cloud service  and comparisons on several projects on cryptography , Machine learning  and cybersecurity.


Some interesting awesome lists being created by  Awesome lists ( although being to overwhelming and unnecessary ) :

1.[kumarsekar awesome Quantum ML](https://github.com/krishnakumarsekar/awesome-quantum-machine-learning#qmlvsdl).
2.[Deep dive on the coding aspects : fomllowing QauntumKatas from the Microsoft ](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumKatas)

there are other numerous comapnies : Pasqal , IBM , DWave  etc . but following above gives sufficient introduction to the 



## Possible Aims of the project :

disseminating State of the art knowledge in the field and also creating an comprehensive resource of the current progress in the field which will seperate the hype from the reality ( sorry google :) ) . as my background corresponds to security , i will start with the obvious concern that how there can be standardisation of the benchmark tools  and analogus tools from classical cs . with the following tutorials 

1. [Implementing standard cryptanalysis models for Quantum Computing framework and examples](QuantumCrypto/README.md).
2. [creating the quantum P2P ecosystem basics]
